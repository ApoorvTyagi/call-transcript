# call-transcript
Momentum.io coding challenge

## Project Description
This application generates, summarizes, and answers questions based on sales call transcripts using OpenAI's API. It saves transcripts to both text files and a MongoDB database for future data retrieval.

The app is structured into separate modules following software engineering principles, making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## Features
- *Generate Transcript*: Creates a realistic sales call transcript and saves it to MongoDB and as a text file to the root directory.
- *Summarize Transcript*: Summarizes & extracts key points from the saved transcript file.
- *Answer Question*: Answers questions based on the transcript content.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd call-Transcript
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```
npm i
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
```
MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your OpenAI API key>
```
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the above variables in it.

4. **Start MongoDB**

Make sure MongoDB is running. This can be locally or via a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.

5. **Run the Application**

Use the commands below to generate, summarize, or answer questions about a transcript.

## Usage Guide
Run the application with the following commands:

1. **Generate Transcript**
```
node src/index.js generate
```
This command generates a transcript and saves it as a file and in the database.

2. **Summarize Transcript**
```
node src/index.js summarize <fileName>
```
- `<fileName>`: The name of the transcript file you want to summarize. The fileName is also returned by `generateTranscript()` called in previous step.

This will extract all the key points from the given transcript.

3. **Answer Questions**
```
node src/index.js answer <fileName> <question>
```

- `<fileName>`: The name of the transcript file you want to query.
- `<question>`: The question you want to ask based on the transcript content.

This will return an answer for the given question.


## Thought Process and Improvements

- **Problem Breakdown**: Divided the project into four main phases for ease of development:
    - **Transcript Service** - Responsible for generating transcripts and saving them to a text file. ([PR #1](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/1))
    - **Analyze Service** - Summarizes the transcript content. ([PR #2](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/2))
    - **Answer Service** - Answers questions based on the transcript content. ([PR #3](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/3))
    - **Database Layer** - Manages saving transcripts and chat history to a database. ([PR #4](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/4))

- **Service Implementation**: Implemented the business logic for each feature within separate files in the `services` folder, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities.

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Utilized OpenAI's official npm library ([openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)) for API calls, following code examples from their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat?lang=node.js). Alternatively, we could have called their APIs directly using `axios`.

- **API Parameters**: After reviewing OpenAI's documentation, configured `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters to optimize response quality. These values were adjusted based on the specific needs of each feature.

- **Database Choice**: Opted for a NoSQL database (MongoDB) due to the flexibility it provides in schema management. With potential future requirements to add or update keys, NoSQL allows for easier scalability without predefined relations.

- **Transcript Schema**: Defined a `transcript model` in MongoDB with three main fields:
    - `fileName` (Indexed for efficient search),
    - `content` (stores transcript content),
    - `chatHistory` (an array of question-answer pairs).

- **Testing**: Added test cases for all three main services. Console output verification was achieved by spying on `console.log`, this logic is generated by AI. ([PR #5](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/5))

- **Code Refactoring** ([PR #6](https://github.com/ApoorvTyagi/call-transcript/pull/6)): Upon confirming functionality, refactored the code to improve structure and modularity:
    - **Third-party API Calls**: Moved OpenAI-related calls to a dedicated file (`/services/openai.js`).
    - **Business Logic**: Isolated core business logic within separate files in the `services` folder.
    - **Database Logic**: Consolidated database interaction functions in `/database/repository.js`.
    - **Environment Configuration**: Centralized environment variable management in `config.js`. This allows other services to import necessary environment variables directly from `config.js`, ensuring a cleaner setup and easier maintenance.
